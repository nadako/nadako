# Hello

I am a multi-instrumentalist programmer with strong focus on game development. I'm in this since I was 7 and never stopped.

I'm interested in everything in and around programming, from gameplay, UX and tooling to GPU programming, memory management and performance awareness. And I'm willing to dive very deep.

I was a very active contributor to the Haxe compiler (OCaml btw), so I know a thing or two about programming languages, compilers, different paradigms and things like meta-programming.

My current job involves Unity and C#, and I know the tech and tools pretty well, including Unity DOTS (Entities/Collections/Jobs/Burst).

For my hobby projects nowadays I'm doing pure C, Odin, Vulkan and generally exploring various low(er)-level stuff.

I maintain a couple of open-source projects that I find useful or interesting here on GitHub, but I have no desire to maintain performative activity just to show off.

Anyway, feel free to approach me :)
